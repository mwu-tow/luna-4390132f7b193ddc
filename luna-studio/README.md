<h1 align="center">Luna Studio</h1>
<h3 align="center">Visual and textual functional programming language with a focus on productivity, collaboration and development ergonomics.</h3>

Luna is a developerâ€™s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together. Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

## Quick installation

The easiest way of installing Luna Studio is by using the graphical Luna Installer, which can be downloaded using the following links:
* Mac OS: http://packages.luna-lang.org/darwin/lunaInstaller.zip
* Linux: http://packages.luna-lang.org/linux/lunaInstaller.zip
* Windows: http://packages.luna-lang.org/windows/lunaInstaller.zip

All you need to do is download and extract the zip and run the application. It will then guide you through the installation process.

## Using Luna Studio

For a tutorial, documentation, explanation of the ideas behind Luna please visit http://docs.luna-lang.org. It is available in a form of a book, to provide a gentle and fairly complete introduction to the application as well as the new visual-textual paradigm.

## Hacking on Luna Studio
Luna's build system is nice and simple, allowing you to bootstrap the compiler
as long as you have an installation of 

[The Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and the
Haskell parser generator `happy`. 

You can install the latter just by running `stack install happy`, which should
build the tool for your system and put it in your `stack` binary folder. 

### System Requirements
While Luna Studio supports Windows as a target operating system, it is not 
currently possible to develop the Luna Studio frontend on Windows. This is due
to the current lack of support by [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) for
Windows at the current time. 

Otherwise, you should be able to develop Luna Studio on reasonably new Linuxes
and MacOS. Luna Studio was mostly tested on Ubuntu >= 14.04, Fedora >= 23, MacOS
\>= 10.11 (El Capitan) and Windows 10, although it should run fine on all Linux 
distros like Mint, Debian or Arch. Please report any issues here on GitHub or 
shoot an email to [contact@luna-lang.org](mailto:contact@luna-lang.org).

### Bootstrapping for Development
To develop Luna Studio, the installation process is quite involved. First of 
all, you will need the [Luna Manager](https://github.com/luna/luna-manager), 
which can be obtained from the linked repository.

The prerequisites for building Luna Studio are the following (with Ubuntu 
`apt-get` package names in parentheses for convenience):

* wget
* gcc, g++, make (build-essential)
* libffi (libffi-dev)
* libgmp (libgmp-dev)
* xz-utils
* zlib (zlib1g-dev)
* git
* gnupg
* ZeroMQ >= 4 (which, interestingly, is libzmq3-dev on Ubuntu)
* libpng (libpng-dev)
* openssl
* SetupTools for Python (python-setuptools)
* libssl (libssl-dev)
* libtinfo (libtinfo-dev)
* pkg-config
* alex
* PIP for Python (python-pip)

Once you are sure that you have the prerequisites installed, you can proceed to
the environment setup. Assuming that you already have the `luna-manager` binary
on your system and available on your `$PATH`, the command is the following:

```
luna-manager develop luna-studio
```

This will install Luna Studio, along with some dependencies (e.g. the Haskell
ecosystem) to `$HOME/luna-develop/apps/luna-studio`. If you wish to install to
a different location, please supply an additional `--path` argument to the
`develop` command. From now on, we will refer to this location as 
`$LUNA_STUDIO_REPO`.

Once the `develop` command finishes executing, you are ready to start developing
Luna Studio. To rebuild the whole application use:

```sh
./build_luna
```

You can choose to rebuild only the frontend or backend part by passing an 
additional flag (`--frontend` or `--backend` respectively).

To run the application in developer mode, use:

```sh
$LUNA_STUDIO_REPO/dist/bin/main/luna-studio --develop
```

### Troubleshooting
Below are a couple of common errors and their resolution steps:

- If during the development process you encounter errors related to missing 
  files (caused by accidental removal of a dependency, for example) you can
  try to execute the following:

```sh
luna-manager develop luna-studio --path $LUNA_STUDIO_REPO --download-dependencies
```

- [Linux] The application image requires FUSE to run. While most Linux 
  distributions have it pre-installed, it is sometimes missing. If your distro
  happens to lack FUSE, you can either install it, or use the following command
  to mount the app image manually:

```sh
sudo mount -o loop Some.AppImage /mnt
/mnt/AppRun
```
