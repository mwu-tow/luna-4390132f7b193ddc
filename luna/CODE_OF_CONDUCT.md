# The Luna Code of Conduct

## Conduct

**Contact**: [luna-mods@luna-lang.org](mailto:luna-mods@luna-lang.org)

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for 
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
  orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
  religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- On Discord, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames 
  that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or 
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom 
  a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you 
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. 
  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including
  the definition in the 
  [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any 
  lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read 
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behaviour that excludes 
  people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel 
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community 
  member, please contact one of the moderators or any of the 
  [Luna moderation team][mod_team] immediately. Whether you're a regular 
  contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place 
  for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing 
  behaviour is not welcome.

## Moderation
These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If 
you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the 
[Luna moderation team][mod_team].

1. Remarks that violate the Luna standards of conduct, including hateful, 
   hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. Cursing is 
   allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of 
   conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out of 
   the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, 
   i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a 
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it 
   up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. 
   Complaints about bans in-server are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a 
   moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway 
   than others.

In the Luna community we all aim to go the extra mile and look out for each 
other. We don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, but we try to be our
very best selves. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive 
topics, particularly if they're off-topic. Doing so all too often leads to
unnecessary fights, hurt feelings and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people
away from the community entirely.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be 
defensive. Just stop what it was they complained about and apologise. Even if 
you feel that you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, it is likely that 
there was something you could've communicated better â€” remember it is _your_
responsibility to make your fellow Luna contributors comfortable. Everyone wants
to get along, and everyone in this community is here first and foremost to talk
about cool technology! You will find that people will be eager to assume good 
intent and forgive as long as there is an atmosphere of trust. 

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Luna venues. This
includes the official discord and GitHub repositories under `luna`.
