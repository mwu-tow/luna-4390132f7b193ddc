<h3 align="center">
Visual and textual functional programming language with a focus on productivity, collaboration and development ergonomics.

Luna is a developerâ€™s whiteboard on steroids. Design, prototype, develop and
refactor any application simply by connecting visual elements together.
Collaborate with co-workers, interactively fine tune parameters, inspect the
results and visually profile the performance in real-time.

Visit [The Luna Website](http://www.luna-lang.org) to learn more!

This repository contains the Luna compiler core and its command line version.
For the full (visual) Luna Studio, please take a look at the
[Luna Studio](https://github.com/luna/luna-studio) repository. For installation
and management tools, there is
[Luna Manager](https://github.com/luna/luna-manager).

## Getting Started
This will get you up and running for Luna development, with only a minimal
amount of setup required.

Luna's build system is nice and simple, allowing you to bootstrap the compiler
as long as you have an installation of
[The Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and the
Haskell parser generator `happy`.

You can install the latter just by running `stack install happy`, which should
build the tool for your system and put it in your `stack` binary folder.

### System Requirements
Luna runs on all reasonably new Linuxes, MacOS, and Windows. Luna was mostly
tested on Ubuntu >= 14.04, Fedora >= 23, MacOS >= 10.11 (El Capitan) and Windows
10, although it should run fine on all Linux distros like Mint, Debian or Arch.
Please report any issues here on GitHub or shoot an email to
[contact@luna-lang.org](mailto:contact@luna-lang.org).

### Getting the Sources
Given you've probably been reading this document on GitHub, you might have an
inkling where to look!. You can clone Luna using two methods:

- **Via HTTPS:** We recommend you only use HTTPS if checking out the sources as
  read-only.

```
git clone https://github.com/luna/luna.git
```

- **Via SSH:** For those who plan on regularly making direct commits, cloning
  over SSH may provide a better user experience (but requires setting up your
  SSH Keys with GitHub).

```
git clone git@github.com:luna/luna.git
```

### Building Luna
To build the command-line compiler interface along with all its sub-components,
you will need to build the `shell` project. The instructions below assume that
your `luna` repo is already cloned and we will refer to its location as
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH`.

```
cd $LUNA_REPO_PATH
stack install
```

Note that the executable for the compiler will be located in
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH/dist/bin/public/luna` folder. You may wish to add it to your
`$PATH`.

Additionally, if you intend to simply use the Luna compiler (as opposed to
tinkering with it, which requires frequent rebuilds), you may consider adding
`--ghc-options="-O2 -j4"` to the stack install command. This should make the
Luna compiler run considerably faster, at the cost of longer build times for
building it.

#### Building Luna Components
It is also possible to build and test each component of Luna (e.g. core, parser)
separately. To do this, pick the component you want from the following list, and
then execute the following command:

```
stack build <component>
stack test <component>
```

Where `<component>` is one of the following:

- `luna-core` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/core`)
- `lune-passes` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/passes`)
- `luna-package` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/package`)
- `luna-runtime` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/runtime`)
- `luna-shell` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/shell`)
- `luna-stdlib` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/stdlib`)
- `luna-syntax-text-lexer` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/syntax/text/lexer`)
- `luna-syntax-text-parser` (found in `$LUNA_REPO_PATH/syntax/text/parser`)

#### Developing with Local Libraries
If you are hacking on the libraries that Luna uses, you'll want to be building
Luna using your local copies of these libraries. These libraries should have
their standard names and be located in the following path:

```
$LUNA_REPO_PATH/../libs/
```

If your libraries are located in this path, you can use the local development
stack `.yaml` file located in `build/stack-local.yaml` to build and test your
version of Luna as follows:

```
stack build --stack-yaml build/stack-local.yaml
```

### Running Luna
As a prerequisite, you need to set a `LUNA_LIBS_PATH` variable to point to the
location of the Luna standard library. Assuming your repo is at
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH`, you will need to set `LUNA_LIBS_PATH` to
`$LUNA_REPO_PATH/stdlib`.

Next, you need to create the project. This is as simple as executing
`luna init <project-path>`, which will create a project in the directory
specified with the correct structure. It will create a defaulted `Main.luna`
file for you as well, allowing you to immediately execute this.

To interpret and run the project, simply type `luna run` in the main project
directory. Alternatively, you can pass the project directory explicitly as
follows:

```
luna run --target path/to/MyProject
```

#### Executing Luna on Standalone Files
The Luna interpreter is also capable of executing standalone Luna files. This
can be done by passing a luna source file to the `--target` flag, similarly to
the above.
